## Design Principles

### Dark Mode and Component Consistency

- Always consider dark mode when adding new UI components. Use color classes that respect the current theme (e.g., `text-ink-700 dark:text-ink-300` instead of fixed color classes).
- Maintain consistent width with other components on the page. Use similar container classes or width settings to ensure new elements align well with existing ones.
- When adding new components or modifying existing ones, check how they look in both light and dark modes, and at various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
